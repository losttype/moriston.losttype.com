# moriston.losttype.com

The minisite for Riley Cran’s Moriston, from your friends at Lost Type.

## Getting started

```
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/losttype/moriston.losttype.com && cd morison

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

The web fonts are not included in this repository, but by default the local versions are used. If you run the project in `production` mode instead,
you can pull the fonts from the [Surge content delivery network](https://surge.sh) and everything should work as expected:

<!-- TODO NODE_ENVIRONMENT="production" -->

```
# Start the project
npm start
# Now available at http://localhost:9000
```
